Starting with version 7.3p1 and up, there's the `Include` keyword, which allows separate configation files to be included.

It's possible to use metacharacters in this statement, so the following is handy, if you have dotfiles and environment-specific ssh configs (e.g. for home, work, etc);

```
Include ~/.ssh/cfg/*
```

You can check your ssh version with `$ ssh -V`.
