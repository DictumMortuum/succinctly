I have been managing my [dotfiles](https://github.com/DictumMortuum/dotfiles) using the alias below.

```
alias dot="git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles.git --work-tree=$HOME"
```

To avoid committing your whole `$HOME` directory to git, use a [.gitignore file](https://github.com/DictumMortuum/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitignore):

```
# Ignore all files
/*
# but keep .ssh
!.ssh
# ignore everything under .ssh, to avoid committing rsa keys, known hosts, etc
.ssh/*
# but keep your config under vcs
!.ssh/config
```
